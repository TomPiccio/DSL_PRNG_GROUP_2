## 1. Introduction
The objective of this project is to utilize an FPGA board, specifically the CMOD A7 35t, to generate a pseudo-random number that can be used for encryption purposes. We plan to achieve this by tapping into the inherent randomness present in environmental data collected by sensors. This data will serve as a seed to initialize an algorithm implemented on the CMOD A7 35t FPGA board. Our project will primarily focus on interfacing the sensors with the FPGA and designing appropriate algorithms to ensure that the generated numbers exhibit strong randomness properties.
